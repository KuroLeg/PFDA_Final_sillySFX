# Silly SFX

Here is a link to my Git Repository [My Repository](https://github.com/KuroLeg/PFDA_Final_sillySFX)

## Description
For my final project I plan to make a soundboard that will host sound effects for creative use. My goal for this soundboard is for it to be used for things susch as streaming or just for recreational use.

## Features
Here are the features I plan to implement: 
- 9 clickable buttons
- text that changes if the user hovers over the respective buton
- The ability to add sound effects to any of the nine buttons
- Hotkeys for each respective button

## Challenges
For this project I will have to learn how to play audio files through PyGame, as well as create my own button object. Also I will have to reasearch a way for the program to detect which buton I'm pressing.

## Outcomes

### <ins>Ideal Outcome</ins>
The ideal outcome for this project is to end up with a soundboard that users can place there own sound effects into and change. As well as hotkeys so users don't need to keep the window open to play the SFX 

### <ins>Minimal Viable Outcome</ins>
The next best outcome would be a program that still has the buttons that can play sound effects but there are no hotkeys for each button, so users have to use their mouse to click every button.

## Milestones
- Create a screen that has buttons on it
- Give these buttons functionality 
- Give the program an appealing design
