# Silly SFX
## by Andres Alcaine



  This project is simply a soundboard, my ultimate goal for this assignment was to make something that I think would be useful. I thought to make a soundboard because I noticed stremers and content creators have little audio clips they play either for emphasis or for comedy. So I thought I could make my own instead of actually having to buy one. 

  When users first run the program they will be greeted with a little module that houses 9 different colored buttons, currently if they run my code these buttons will have already been loaded with their own sound effects, and the name , or a description of the sound will be visibly on the button to differentiate them from one another. Obviously if you left-click a button with the mouse the sound effect will play, users can spam click each button and the sound will play as the user clicks. If a user clicks one button and then as the first clip plays they click a second button  the second clip will staert to play, basically users can play two different sounds at the same time, my code only allows for one sound to be played at a time. I added a visual indicator for when users left-click a button, this visual indicator changes both the button size and the text. Users will also notice that each button has it's own color. However if users don't like the colors each button has, they can change them, if users look into the code I provided more colors within the pallete I chose for them to change the button colors. I also added more custimizeation for the buttons, I allow users to change the name of all the buttons, all they would need to do is change the text perameter within the button call. Lastly and most important, If users don't want to use the sound effects I provided in the code they can get their own audio files and place them within the code.

  Within my Github repository there's a proposal.md, a REDME.md, and my src folder. This is my README.md file, and the proposal.md is just my project proposal. In my src folder there are a couple files. First, and most obvious, is the actual python file that runs my code. Also there are 9 seperate audio files I provided for the program. 

  I would say this program taught me some new things that I can realy see the use for. I had to learn how to play the audio through Pygame, and I had to learn how to create buttons through object creation. I think this project turned out exactly as I imagined and 'm pretty happy with the results.
